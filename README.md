## Important information

* Due date: `28 February 2025`

### Activity

### Deliverables

The `Research Roadmap` for this project will relate to the disciplinary paper assigned on the [course calendar](https://chompe.rs/580-schedule).
Use the following table to determine which resource to use in combination with your paper.

|Paper               |Associated Resource                                 |
|:-------------------|:---------------------------------------------------|
|_Fat Pointers in C_ |https://zenodo.org/records/7719431                  |
|_Tidy Data_         |https://github.com/metmuseum/openaccess/            |
|_Quality of Metadata in Open Portals_|Choose `RDF` from: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/ |
|_Evaluating Web Software Reliability Based on Workload and Failure Data Extracted from Server Logs_ | https://chompe.rs/cmpsc-580-se-log |

To assist with producing a `Roadmap` this time, your first step should be to search for accompanying repositories or artifacts either mentioned
in the paper _or_ associated with the paper title. Nearly all of the above papers have a Github repository or other tool that you can use
to complete work.

#### Research Roadmap

Students will complete this project in a team assigned to you based on your chosen discipline (degree program);
each team will be given an assignment repository with guidelines for completing the work.

The `Research Roadmap` for this project should include:

- a description of the starting point and final goal of the research plan represented with:
  - a topic summary
  - two research questions:
    - an articulation the original research question behind the experiment
    - an original research question not posed by the assigned source paper which suggests a new direction of study, which your team will pursue
- a visualization of the roadmap of steps taken to reproduce _one experiment_ in the assigned paper, including:
  - the discrete steps creating a reproducible process that conducts the experiment
  - any additional resources consulted in order to complete the project, including:
    - generative prompts
    - "how-to" guides
    - additional research necessary to understand concepts accounting for relationships between sources
    - inclusion of paths/processes that lead to any dead-ends or failures
- a visualization of the roadmap of steps and taken to produce one _original_ experiment from your research question, including:
  - the discrete steps creating a reproducible process that conducts the experiment
  - any additional resources consulted in order to complete the project, including:
    - generative prompts
    - "how-to" guides
    - additional research necessary to understand concepts accounting for relationships between sources
    - inclusion of paths/processes that lead to any dead-ends or failures

> Notes:
> * both experiments should use _one_ single roadmap which demonstrates the relationship between the parts of this assignment
> * sourcing and other pieces of this project will be completed by other course activities including various `* Log` posts
